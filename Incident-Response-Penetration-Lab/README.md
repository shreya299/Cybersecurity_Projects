## Overview
This project simulates a full cybersecurity engagement — from vulnerability assessment and penetration testing to incident detection and response.  
It was performed in a controlled home lab environment using intentionally vulnerable machines (**Metasploitable** and **Bee-Box**) to practice reconnaissance, exploitation, monitoring, and post-incident remediation.

## 🧾 Project Summary

| Category | Details |
|-----------|----------|
| **Project Goal** | Simulate a real-world cybersecurity workflow — from vulnerability assessment and penetration testing to incident detection and response. |
| **Environment** | Virtual Lab: Metasploitable, Bee-Box, Ubuntu, pfSense Firewall |
| **Focus Areas** | Vulnerability Scanning · Exploitation · Incident Response · Threat Detection |
| **Tools & Frameworks** | Nmap · Nessus / OpenVAS · Metasploit · Wireshark · CVSS Scoring · MITRE ATT&CK |
| **Key Results** | - Identified and exploited multiple CVEs (FTP, PHP, Drupal).<br>- Simulated Red Team attack and Blue Team response.<br>- Built an end-to-end Incident Response Plan (IRP). |
| **Deliverables** | Vulnerability Assessment Report · Penetration Test Report · Incident Response Reports (PDFs) |
| **Outcome** | Improved detection, remediation, and documentation skills across Red and Blue team workflows. |

## Project Components

### 1) Vulnerability Assessment — RED Team  
**File:** [vulnerability assessment report_RED Team.pdf](./vulnerability%20assessment%20report_RED%20Team.pdf)  
- Conducted reconnaissance and scanning using **Nmap** and **OpenVAS/Nessus**.  
- Discovered and categorized vulnerabilities across Metasploitable and Bee-Box.  
- Notable issues: outdated software, directory traversal, SSL/TLS misconfigurations, DoS exposures, and **ProFTPD mod_copy (CVE-2015-3306)**.  
- Mapped findings to CVE IDs and CVSS scores for prioritization.

### 2) Penetration Test — RED Team  
**File:** [Pentest_Report_RED Team.pdf](./Pentest_Report_RED%20Team.pdf)  
- Performed controlled exploitation using **Metasploit** to validate critical vulnerabilities.  
- Demonstrated code execution and reverse shells via the **ProFTPD mod_copy exploit (CVE-2015-3306)**.  
- Executed SSH authentication and privilege-escalation testing.  
- Recommended mitigations: patching, network segmentation, and stronger authentication mechanisms.

### 3) Incident Report & Response — BLUE Team  
**Files:**  
- [Incident Report.pdf](./Incident%20Report.pdf) — Blue Team evidence and findings (packet captures, logs, and host analysis).  
- [Incident Response Plan.pdf](./Incident%20Response%20Plan.pdf) — Formal playbook: containment, eradication, recovery, communication, and lessons learned.

**Summary:**  
- The Blue Team used **Wireshark** to monitor network traffic, detect suspicious activity, and correlate events with Red Team activity.  
- Incident response actions included host isolation, vulnerability remediation, and log analysis.  
- Deliverables: a sanitized **Incident Report** (evidence + analysis) and an actionable **Incident Response Plan (IRP)**.

## How to use this repository
1. Review the **Vulnerability Assessment Report** to understand baseline weaknesses.  
2. Read the **Penetration Test Report** to explore exploit paths and validation steps.  
3. Refer to the **Incident Report** and **Incident Response Plan** for mitigation and post-incident learning.
